## Bot

### When did the bot get started?

Most information from the bot is obtained from the game itself by way of creative data gathering. This way, the accuracy of the information can be guaranteed.

### Do I need to keep paying for Premium?

In general, the answer to this is yes to be able to keep the bot up and running. However, exceptions can be made in certain circumstances.

### If I do stop, how long do I get to keep Premium?

If you decide you want to stop supporting the bot for any reason, you'll lose access to Premium at the start of the next month.
So say you stop supporting at the 14th, you'll keep Premium until the 1st of the next month.

Eligible content creators include: tool creators, information gatherers, map creators and other people that help the community found out more information about the game.

## Issues

### Why doesn't the bot respond?

This can have multiple causes. Perhaps the bot doesn't have proper permission to talk in that channel. It could also be that the bot is down briefly for some updates.

### Why is the bot talking in a different language?

:::note
To learn more about languages, visit the [languages guide](./guides/languages).
:::

### Why can't the bot find something I look for?

If the bot can't find something, try using slightly different keywords. Sometimes something is known differently in the game than what you're looking for.
A common example of this is looking for `buffalo` while the actual name is `bison`. Of course, the thing you're looking for might just not be in the bot.
If you believe this is the case, please leave feedback using the appropriate button.

### How come the bot doesn't detect me as Administrator?

The bot determines whether you are an administrator or not by checking whether you have the Administrator permission. Please make sure you have the permission or ask your server owner for help.

### I'm having a different issue. How can I get help?

If you experience an issue that you can't seem to solve, you can reach out in the support server at any time and you'll get help as soon as possible. You can also use the `/feedback` command
to leave feedback directly from Discord.
