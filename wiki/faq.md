## Bot

### When did the bot get started?

The bot got started in June of 2020. At that time the bot started to get a few basic functionalities.

The bot was developed by Senexis. He is currently the only developer for the bot. A full list of all contributors can be found by using the !credits command.

### How often does the bot get an update?

The bot gets updated around once every 4 days. Content that is added in a game update gets added to the bot as soon as possible, usually with some information that isn't widely known yet.

### How accurate is the bot's information?

Most information from the bot is obtained from the game itself by way of creative data gathering. This way, the accuracy of the information can be guaranteed.

### How can I support the bot?

You can support the bot monetarily by becoming a Patron, or you can spread the word about the bot. Both are greatly appreciated!

## Premium

### What is Premium?

Supporting the bot with â‚¬3.99 or more on Patreon will enable you to automate certain notifications and create fun assets to play around with.

### What exactly do I get with Premium?

Premium members get access to a selection of Premium-only commands and access to a host of automatic notification options.

### How do I activate Premium?

If you've become a Patron in the Premium or VIP tier, make sure to link your Discord account to your Patreon account (more information).
Once you did that, you'll get access to the #get-your-premium channel in the support server.
All you need to do then is post your server's ID or an invite and your Premium will be activated by a bot administrator.

### Do I need to keep paying for Premium?

In general, the answer to this is yes to be able to keep the bot up and running. However, exceptions can be made in certain circumstances.
In light of recent global events it is perfectly reasonable to want to cancel your support. Any support you can offer is appreciated.

### If I do stop, how long do I get to keep Premium?

If you decide you want to stop supporting the bot for any reason, you'll lose access to Premium at the start of the next month.

Eligible content creators include: tool creators, information gatherers, map creators and other people that help the community found out more information about the game.

## Issues

### Why doesn't the bot respond?

This can have multiple causes. Perhaps the bot doesn't have proper permission to talk in that channel. It could also be that the bot is down briefly for some updates.

### Why is the bot talking in a different language?

This is currently a known issue. Using the command !settings set language en or your preferred language is a possible workaround.

### Why does the bot respond very slowly in my server only?

When a server is detected to continuously abuse the bot's commands, the server gets limited by the bot.
If the server is limited, the bot will increasingly respond slower and slower, starting with 10 seconds between commands.

### Why can't the bot find something I look for?

When the bot can't find something, it doesn't necessarily mean that the bot doesn't have the information you're looking for. You can try asking the bot differently.
If you are using the bot in different language, it could be that the searching just doesn't detect certain characters. Try using more precise spelling.

### How come the bot doesn't detect me as Administrator?

This is likely due to you not meeting the requirements of either being in a role set as adminRole or having the Administrator permission. Try asking your server's owner to check this for you.

### I'm having a different issue! How can I get help?

If you experience an issue that you can't seem to solve, you can reach out in the support server at any time and you'll get help as soon as possible.
