# Events

Free Roam Events pings are notices sent to you 10 minutes before Free Roam Events begin in the game. They can be configured using the `/settings set events` command. There are multiple options
available to ping. You can find a list of all the different options in the lists below, as well as a description of what each option does. In the case of individual Free Roam Events, you can quickly
see the type of combat that event entails. This is useful for knowing which Free Roam Event is included with the corresponding special options.

## Special Options

The following options include multiple Free Roam Events. When configuring a ping using these options, one or more Free Roam Events may be pinged. You can discover which type of event is being pinged
by reading the description. In addition, for combat options, the type of combat included in a Free Roam Event is listed in the tables in the following sections.
