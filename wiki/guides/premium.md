# Premium

While the bulk of the features of RDO Compendium are free, there are some Premium features that are only available to those who choose to support the development and continued availability of the
bots through Patreon. If you are interested in supporting the bots, thank you very much! On this page you’ll find more info about the Premium features, how to activate your premium benefits, and
how to manage them.

## Premium Benefits

The currently available Premium benefits include:

- Pings: The ability to automate messages like Daily Challenges, Madam Nazar, Rockstar News, and more;
- Premium Commands: Get access to various Premium-only commands like `/toast` and `/audio`;
- Priority Support: Whether it’s a question, suggestion, or bug, we’ll help you as soon as we can;
- Status Updates: Keep up-to-date with RDO.GG projects through the Patron-only posts;
- More to come! We’re working hard on adding more Premium-only commands and features, so stay tuned!

## Activating Premium

To activate Premium, first head over to our Patreon page and choose one of the available tiers that provide you with access to the Premium features. If you decide to pledge to one of the tiers, you

2. Join the RDO.GG Support Discord;
3. Create an invite link for the server you want to activate, or ask a staff member to create one for you;
4. Use the `/premium activate` command together with the link to activate your server.

:::tip
If you are not able to use the `/premium` commands, it means that you have not been assigned a role in the support Discord yet. Please wait up to 24 hours for a role to be assigned to you.
If after waiting you still don’t have a role, please contact the RDO.GG Support staff.

## Switching Servers

Sometimes you may want to switch servers and take your Premium benefits with you. Here’s how to get your new server set up with those benefits:

1. Join the RDO.GG Support Discord;
2. Use the `/premium list` command to see all of your currently activated servers;
3. For the server you want to switch from, use the `/premium remove` command together with the name to deactivate that server;
4. Create an invite link for the server you want to activate, or ask a staff member to create one for you;
5. For the server you want to switch to, use the `/premium activate` command together with the link to activate your server.

:::caution
If you decide you want to switch servers, the Premium benefits will be removed from the server you are switching from, which will reset all Premium-only settings to their defaults.
