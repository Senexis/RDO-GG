# Commands

Starting out, the bot may seem a bit intimidating to you. However, fret not since this page will help you to get started with the bot by explaining the different commands,
and giving you tips and tricks on finding whatever it is you want to find within Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online.

Commands are how you control the bot. If you type `/help` in a channel the bot is in, it will reply to you with a list of all commands available within the bot for example.
Some commands may require you to provide more information, such as the `/find` command, which is used by typing `/find bear` to search for a bear, for example.

If you ever get stuck, feel free to reach out on the bot's Discord server for additional support.
