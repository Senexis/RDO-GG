RDO Compendium is available in multiple languages. Thanks to the help of the translators, the bot is available in English, Deutsch, Español (España), Español (México), Français, Italiano, Polski,
Português (Brasil), Русский, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文, and 한국어.

To change the language of the bot for your server, you are able to use the `!settings` command to change the language. To do so, you can use `!settings set language <language>`, replacing `<language>`
with any one of the following: `de`, `en`, `es`, `esmx`, `fr`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `pl`, `ptbr`, `ru`, `zhs`, or `zht`.

To change the language of the bot for just one command, for example if you can't understand the language the bot is set to within a server, you can use `!de`, `!en`, `!es`, `!esmx`, `!fr`, `!it`,
`!ja`, `!ko`, `!pl`, `!ptbr`, `!ru`, `!zhs`, or `!zht` followed by your command to change the language of the bot to the corresponding language for just that command.

The bot will always respond and listen to English commands when private messaging.
Please note that the server you're on can opt to disable this functionality if the rules direct you to talking only in a single language.
