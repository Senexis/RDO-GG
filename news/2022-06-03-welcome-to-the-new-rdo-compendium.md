# Welcome to the new RDO Compendium

After a bunch of tinkering, the next version of RDO Compendium is now available to everyone. Using some of Discord's new features, the bot should now be able to help you in a much more streamlined way.

<!--truncate-->

Feel free to try out the new version of the bot! If at any point you experience an issue, or if you have general feedback, please feel free to use /feedback any time and let me know, or hop into the support Discord at [http://rdo.gg/discord/](http://rdo.gg/discord/).

If you need help, we have multiple guides available on the newly revamped site. From guides to information, and the latest news and updates, visit [http://rdo.gg/](http://rdo.gg/)!

Thank you so much for sticking around, and we hope you enjoy the new version of the bot!
