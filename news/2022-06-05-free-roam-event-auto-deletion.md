# Free Roam Event Auto-Deletion

Hey folks!

Yesterday, a new setting was added to auto-delete old messages using /settings set boolean > Delete Old Messages. Just now, the bot has been updated to also remove Free Roam Events.

<!--truncate-->

The way this works is by deleting older Free Roam Events posted in the channel as soon as a new one is posted. Because you might have a channel set up for specific Free Roam Events, it will always ensure that your filters are used. This means that old Free Roam Events will be deleted only when a new one is posted in that channel. If a Free Roam Event is posted in another channel, the old Free Roam Event will remain untouched in the first channel.

In other news:

- Over 300 new /toast icons have been added.
- Various issues have been fixed.
