# February 2022: Bot Reverified

Hello, folks! I have some exciting news to share! The bot was successfully verified yesterday and is now available for the general public! You can add the bot either in-app by opening the bot's profile and clicking **Add to Server**, or by heading to the dedicated invite link and following the instructions.

The bot being verified means that hopefully, we can put the entire situation behind us. Due to Discord being uncooperative, it's unlikely the old bot will be coming back. I will be focusing on this new verified account instead. Any updates on the situation with the older bot (the one with the white letters **R** and **D**, and the red **O**) will be shared if I receive any reaction from Discord.

Thank you so much for sticking with me through these times. As previously announced on Discord, development on the next version of the bot has been resumed. This version will make use of Discord's newest features and prepare for the future. More information on this will be provided later.

Have a good one!
