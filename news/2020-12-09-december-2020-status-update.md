# December 2020: Status Update

Hello everyone! As I did previously, I wanted to provide a brief overview of the current state of the bot. Due to certain global events, my motivation to work as diligently on the bot as before has decreased slightly. Despite this, I've managed to keep up with updates, which fortunately hasn't been too demanding. However, some of the planned features for the bot have unfortunately been put on the back burner for now.

I've been addressing and resolving multiple issues automatically reported with the bot, and more fixes are scheduled to be implemented very soon. This should resolve certain issues, such as event images occasionally not displaying properly, among other things.

To give you an idea of the number of fixes, there have been five critical fixes and over a dozen minor fixes, along with numerous translation improvements and corrections. While this wasn't the original plan for this month, I hope these efforts allow you to continue enjoying the bot.

Regarding the future, I intend to resume regular updates as soon as possible. Although I can't provide a definite date for when efforts will return to normal, I aim to resume normal activities by the start of the new year at the latest.

I want to express how much I appreciate the support over the last few months. I cannot emphasize enough how meaningful it is that this little bot has been so helpful to all of you. Thank you so much for contributing to the bot's growth and supporting it both financially and in other ways (shout-out to the translations team!).

Once again, thank you so much!
