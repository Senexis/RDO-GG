# New Setting Added

Hey folks!

In the old version of the bot, users often requested the ability to delete old messages as soon as new ones were posted. This can now be achieved by enabling the "Delete Old Messages" setting using the /settings set boolean command.

<!--truncate-->

Keep in mind that this won't work for messages that have already been sent. If you want the one-post-per-channel experience, make sure to delete the old messages! You can use purge commands provided by various moderation bots, or simply delete and re-create the channel for a hassle-free experience.

Auto-deletion of Free Roam Events is a bit more complicated and will be added in a future update. As soon as you enable the setting, they will be tracked as well, and will be deleted as soon as that portion is ready.
