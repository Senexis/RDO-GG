# The state of RDO Compendium

Hey everyone! Don't worry, there's nothing drastic happening and the bot isn't going anywhere anytime soon! Let's talk about what's next for the RDO Compendium bot.

<!--truncate-->

Mainly, the plan is to keep providing those basic security updates to make sure the bot stays safe for everyone to use. We'll also be doing our best to keep the existing features working as well as possible, even with the limitations out there.

One thing you'll notice is that the "/live" command is being removed. Unfortunately, this command relied on stuff that Rockstar Games has removed, so it just doesn't work anymore. We know this might be a bummer for some, but it's no longer possible to keep that going. At least "/benefits" still works which provides you with essentially the same information. Other commands might have to be removed in the future depending on which functionality might be removed by Rockstar Games in the future. For context, certain features within the game's online portion have been [disabled in September of last year](https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/27571099657235/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-Title-Update-1-32-Notes-PS4-Xbox-One-PC). There's no way to know what else might be getting disabled in the future.

On a more positive note, as always, I'm still going to be really involved in the community Discord server. I'm genuinely interested in hearing your feature requests and ideas as they come up. While the focus is primarily on maintenance, I'm always looking at ways to improve things where we can. This includes any issues you may have in using the bot.

If you notice something being broken that I haven't yet please do let me know so I can get right on it. Hop on into the [Discord community server](http://rdo.gg/discord) and let me know what you think!

So, the goal is to keep the RDO Compendium bot a solid resource for as long as we can, focusing on what's still possible. Thanks for sticking with the bot and being part of the community!
