# September 2020: Status Update

Hi all! Just thought I'd give you all a quick update on the status of the bot! Time and time again I come across people using the bot off and on in multiple Discord servers -- this is great to see!
Some of you are really enthusiastically using it and it's been awesome to see how many people spread the word about the bot. I can't thank you all enough!

Now, you may be thinking, why hasn't there been many updates yet? Well, simply put, I'm running out of ideas about what kind of stuff to add for you to find, get information about, and use. Seeing as
Rockstar doesn't update the game all that often, there will likely be more down times like these where there's simply nothing much to add.

However! I still have the feeling a bunch is missing from the bot currently, and so I'd like you all to go and reach out to me on the Discord server for the bot and send in
your ideas! If you can think of anything you'd like to be able to find more about within the bot, do feel free to let me know. While you're sending your suggestions in please also make sure to give
me an idea on what kind of information you'd like to find when the bot is displaying the thing you want to find.

Thank you all again so much for the support, even during down time where there's not much to be added by me. This bot will continue to be update when the game updates as soon as possible, just like
the Harrietum Officinalis herb, which has been added on the same day as it's been released within the game!

Please, don't hesitate to send any suggestions in or ask for help at any time.
