# September 2020: Status Update

Hi everyone! I wanted to provide a quick update on the bot's status. It's fantastic to see many of you actively using the bot across various Discord serversâ€”thank you for your enthusiasm in spreading the word!
Some users have been using it quite enthusiastically, and it's been amazing to witness how the bot's popularity has grown. I truly appreciate all of your support!

Now, you might be wondering why there haven't been many updates recently. Simply put, I'm running low on ideas for new features to add, information to provide, and ways for you to engage with the bot. Given that Rockstar doesn't frequently update the game, there will likely be more periods like these where there's not much to add.

However, I still feel that there's a lot missing from the bot at the moment. I encourage all of you to reach out to me on the Discord server for the bot and share your ideas! If there's anything specific you'd like to find within the bot, please let me know. When sending your suggestions, also provide an idea of the kind of information you'd like to see when the bot displays the content you're searching for.

Once again, thank you all for your continued support, even during times when there's not much for me to add. The bot will be updated whenever the game receives updates, just like the Harrietum Officinalis herb, which was added to the bot on the same day it was released in the game!

Please don't hesitate to send in your suggestions or ask for help anytime.
