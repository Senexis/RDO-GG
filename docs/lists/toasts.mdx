# Toasts

import Toasts from '@site/src/components/Toasts';

Here's a list of all items that can be used as an icon in the **/toast** command. To find a toast, type (part of) its name below. Depending on the language, you may need to type the equivalent name in the language of your server.

You can customize the color of the icons by using the `icon-color` option. You can find a full list of Red Dead Online colors on the [colors page](/wiki/lists/colors)!
