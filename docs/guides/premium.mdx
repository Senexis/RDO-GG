# Premium

import PatreonButtons from '@site/src/components/PatreonButtons';

While the bulk of the features of RDO Compendium are free, there are some Premium benefits that are only available to those who choose to support the development and continued availability of the bots through Patreon. If you are interested in supporting RDO.GG, thank you very much! On this page, you’ll find more info about the Premium benefits, how to activate them, and how to manage them.

:::tip

If you don't feel like reading, here are the commands:

- `/settings premium`: See whether your server has Premium benefits.
- `/premium activate`: Activate your server.
- `/premium deactivate`: Deactivate your server.
- `/premium list`: List the servers you've activated.

You can use these in the [RDO.GG Support Discord](https://rdo.gg/discord/).

The currently available Premium benefits include:

- Pings: The ability to automate messages like Daily Challenges, Madam Nazar, Rockstar News, and more;

## Becoming a Patron

If you’d like to become a Patron, you can do so by visiting the [Patreon page](https://rdo.gg/patreon/) or using the buttons below. There, you can pick the tier that best matches your requirements. Whether you need only 1 Premium server or 25 with extra features, there's probably a tier that matches your needs.

<PatreonButtons />

To pledge to a tier of your choosing, click the button of the tier you'd like to pledge to, then follow the steps on screen to complete the process. Once you've pledged to a tier, make sure to connect your Discord account to the Patreon account you just used to pledge. This will allow us to verify your pledge and grant you access to your Premium benefits.

Please note that the Supporter tier does not include Premium benefits, as it is intended for those who just want to support the development of RDO Compendium and its surrounding services. To see the benefits that a tier provides, you can click the **Show tier description** button on the tier's checkout page to get a summary, or visit the [Patreon page](https://rdo.gg/patreon/) to see the full details.

## Managing Premium

### Server Status

To check if your server has Premium benefits activated, you can use `/settings premium` to quickly see the server's Premium status. If the bot replies with "this server _already has access_ to Premium benefits," then you're all good! If, on the other hand it replies with "this server _currently does not have_ Premium benefits activated," continue reading to get your server activated.

### Activating Premium

To activate Premium, first head over to our Patreon page and choose one of the available tiers that provide you with access to your Premium benefits. If you decide to pledge to one of the tiers, you can use the following steps to get your Premium benefits:

1. Become a Patron and link your Patreon account to your Discord account;
2. Join the [RDO.GG Support Discord](https://rdo.gg/discord/);
3. Create an invite link for the server you want to activate, or ask a staff member to create one for you;
4. Use the `/premium activate` command together with the link to activate your server.

:::tip
If you are not able to use the `/premium` commands, it means that you have not been assigned a role in the support Discord yet. Please make sure you've linked your Discord account to your Patreon account, then wait up to 24 hours for a role to be assigned to you. If after waiting you still don’t have a role, please contact the RDO.GG Support staff.

### Switching Servers

Sometimes you may want to switch servers and take your Premium benefits with you. To do this, you can deactivate one server and activate another instead. Here’s how to get your new server set up with those benefits:

1. Join the [RDO.GG Support Discord](https://rdo.gg/discord/);
2. Use the `/premium list` command to see all of your currently activated servers;
3. For the server you want to switch from, use the `/premium deactivate` command together with the name to deactivate that server;
4. Create an invite link for the server you want to activate, or ask a staff member to create one for you;
5. For the server you want to switch to, use the `/premium activate` command together with the link to activate your server.

### Deactivating a Server

If you decide you want to stop providing Premium benefits to a server, you can use the following steps to remove your Premium benefits from it:

1. Join the [RDO.GG Support Discord](https://rdo.gg/discord/);
2. Use the `/premium list` command to see all of your currently activated servers;
3. For the server you want to deactivate, use the `/premium deactivate` command together with the name to deactivate that server.

:::danger
Deactivating all servers does not automatically stop your pledge on Patreon. If you wish to stop your paying for your pledge, you must do so on Patreon.

## Managing your Pledge

### Editing your Pledge

If at any point you feel like you need some more or fewer slots for Premium servers, you can edit your pledge to change the number of slots you have. To do this, you can edit your pledge through Patreon. If you need instructions on how to manage your pledge, please visit [this Patreon support article](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000126286).

### Cancelling your Pledge

If you decide you no longer want to pledge to RDO.GG on Patreon, you can cancel your pledge at any time. By doing so, you will no longer be charged for your pledge, and you will lose access to your Premium benefits. After you've cancelled your pledge, you will continue to have access to your Premium benefits until the next week. In order to cancel your pledge, you can use the instructions found on [this Patreon support article](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005502572).

If you have a moment after canceling your pledge, we'd like you to answer the exit survey to help us understand why you canceled your pledge. This will help us fix any issues you might've had or improve RDO.GG further in the future.

### Getting a Refund

If you had a bad experience with RDO.GG or if you just don't think it's quite a good fit for you, please reach out to us on the support Discord server and we'll be happy to provide you with a refund for the current month. Please note that in order to be eligible for a no-questions-asked refund, you must have been a Patron for no more than 14 days.

We may provide refunds to Patrons who have pledged for longer than 14 days in certain circumstances, so please do still reach out if you've been a Patron for longer than 14 days to see if you are eligible for a refund. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide refunds for any pledges made over 3 months ago.
