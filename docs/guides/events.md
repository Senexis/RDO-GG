# Events

Free Roam Events pings are notices sent 10 minutes before Free Roam Events begin in the game. You can configure them using the `/settings set events` command. Different options are available for pinging, and you can find them in the lists below, along with a description of each option. Individual Free Roam Events provide details about the type of combat involved.

## Special Options

These options cover multiple Free Roam Events. When configuring a ping using these options, one or more Free Roam Events may be pinged. You can determine the type of event being pinged by reading the description. Combat types for each Free Roam Event are listed in the tables in the following sections.
