# Languages

RDO Compendium is available in multiple languages, thanks to the contributions of the [translators](/wiki/credits/translators). To change the language for your server, use the `/settings` command and select a language using `/settings set language`.

Once the language is set, RDO Compendium will automatically respond in the chosen language. For instance, if you set it to English, RDO Compendium will reply in English when you use `/help`.

In some cases, you may encounter content that hasn't been translated. This could be due to the content not being translated yet, external sources like news articles or notifications, or if the content is sent in a direct message.
