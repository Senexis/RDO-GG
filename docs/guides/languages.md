# Languages

RDO Compendium is available in multiple languages. Thanks to the help of the [translators](/wiki/credits/translators), RDO Compendium is available in quite a few languages. To change the language of RDO Compendium
for your server, you are able to use the `/settings` command to change the language. To do so, you can use `/settings set language` with any one of the available languages.

Once the language has been set, RDO Compendium will automatically reply to commands in the language you have set. For example, if you set the language to English, RDO Compendium will reply in English when you use
`/help`.

In certain circumstances, you may encounter content that's not been translated. This can have one of multiple causes:

- The content is not yet translated into the language you have set;
- The content is from an external source such as a news article of a notification, or;
- The content is sent in a direct message.
