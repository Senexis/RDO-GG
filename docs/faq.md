## Issues

### Why doesn't RDO Compendium respond?

This can have multiple causes. Perhaps RDO Compendium doesn't have proper permission to talk in that channel. It could also be that RDO Compendium is down briefly for some updates.

### Why can't I see RDO Compendium's commands?

Make sure that you have the **Use Application Commands** permission. In addition, check whether you have set up RDO Compendium's application permissions in such a way that they command you're trying to use is allowed to be used in the channel itself. If you need help getting that set up, please visit the [Discord support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4644915651095-Command-Permissions) for more information about Slash command permissions.

### Why don't emoji work when using commands?

The common reason emoji don't work is because RDO Compendium doesn't have the **Use External Emoji** permission. Please make sure to add the permission to RDO Compendium's role, and make sure the channel you're using commands in doesn't override (deny) the permission for RDO Compendium.

If you've made sure RDO Compendium has the permission, but still don't see the emoji, please check whether the `@everyone` role has the permission in the channel. A Discord quirk is that in order for commands to respond with emoji, both the `@everyone` role and RDO Compendium needs to have the **Use External Emoji** permission. Please note that you don't need to add the permission to the role itself, just adding it to the channel will do the trick.

:::info
Regarding the Discord quirk, here's what Discord has to say:

> We are working right now to make this more logical. There are important edge cases to be mindful of, like how moderators can control this permission when there is not a bot user in the server. But we know this is a pain point, and are currently addressing it.

You can read more about this [here (question no. 18)](https://time-mambo-c70.notion.site/DDevs-May-27-Q-A-17431321344b4ce7915fe7b5f83b1f41).

### Why can't RDO Compendium find something I look for?

If RDO Compendium can't find something, try using slightly different keywords. Sometimes something is known differently in the game than what you're looking for. A common example of this is looking for `buffalo` while the actual name is `bison`. Of course, the thing you're looking for might just not be in RDO Compendium. If you believe this is the case, please leave feedback using the appropriate button.

### How come RDO Compendium doesn't detect me as an Administrator?

RDO Compendium determines whether you are an administrator or not by checking whether you have the Administrator permission. Please make sure you have the permission or ask your server owner for help.

### Why is RDO Compendium talking in a different language?

To learn more about languages, please visit the [languages guide](./guides/languages).

### I'm having a different issue. How can I get help?

If you experience an issue that you can't seem to solve, you can reach out in the support server at any time and you'll get help as soon as possible. You can also use the `/feedback` command to leave feedback directly from Discord.
