> Hi [removed],
> 
> Your request [removed] has been updated. To add additional comments, please reply to this email.
> 
> Cheers,
> The Discord Team

> Clyde (Discord)
> 
> NOTE: You will need to reply to this email if you would like to forward this ticket to our support team!
> This is an automated response to your ticket [removed]!
> 
> Hey there,
> 
> I’m terribly sorry that you went through this kind of experience with your account. Because I noticed you were writing in about a compromised account, I wanted to double check these steps before escalating this ticket to one of our support specialists.
> 
> Did you receive a notification email about a password change?
> You can use the forgot password feature available from the login page here: https://discordapp.com/login to regain access into the account and reset the password. You need to type in your email address associated with the account and then click "forgot password", and then you should get an email shortly with a link you can use to reset your Password. Here's a link with more information as well: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/218410947
> On the other hand, did the email to your Discord account get changed?
> If so, in order for our team to investigate further, could you respond to this message with a confirmation of your suspicions on how the account was compromised and the email was changed? Additionally could you explicitly state the original/previously registered email address and the Discord tag (username and 4 digit discriminator) tied to the Discord account?
> Note: We need to receive the request from the email address originally associated with the Discord account to protect our users' privacy and security.
> 
> For future reference, we recommend you 1) update and change your email address password, 2) make sure to have a strong password and 3) enable two factor authentication on your Discord account! You can also check out password managers like 1Password or Dashlane which make creating and storing secure passwords a breeze. If you need more help setting up 2FA, you can check out how to enable it onto your Discord account through this link: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication

> Best,
> Discord Support Team
> 
> REMINDER: If none of the above solved your issue/question, you will need to reply back to this email if you would like to forward this ticket to our support team!

### Senexis, Sun, Dec 5, 2021 at 5:58 AM
> Hey there Jan,
> 
> Thank you for reaching out. Currently the account is indeed linked to my email address, yes, although that doesn't mean all that much. My password has been changed and its 2FA method has been changed. Therefore, when I go to reset the password I cannot continue as I do not have access to the updated 2FA method.
> 
> I still have the back-up codes saved, however, those do not work anymore either.
> 
> Please advise,
> 
> [removed].

### Senexis, Sun, Dec 5, 2021 at 6:23 AM
> In the meantime while I'm waiting for you to respond, what I find a little weird is this.
> 
> The attacker is currently logged in. Obviously I'm trying to get my account recovered here, yet you still allow the attacker to remain signed in and potentially causing damage.
> 
> You will be able to see that the logger in IP is different from what it was yesterday at 10 PM (Europe/Amsterdam). You will be able to see that the password has been changed around 11 PM, as well as both 2FA and the email address. You will be able to see that around 11.30 PM I managed to get the email address back to [removed].
> 
> Yet despite all this you haven't locked the account down nor invalidated all sessions. That's how this happened. The program I ran that was sent to me by what I thought was my friend Serg around 10.30 PM grabbed all cookies off my PC and used that to log into my account.
> 
> Why can you not just lock the account down? The fact that someone is using my account right now is excruciating. Even though I know all information, am mailing you from the email address that's linked to it, can give you entire lists of previously valid backup codes, and can even provide you with my photo identity (my sent you my ID through the bot verification program), I am powerless here.

Note regarding this message: If you experience similar feelings, please know that there are various resources available to get help. From friends and family to professional help, please make sure to not let these feelings go too far. I got help for these issues and am fine now. These topics have purposefully not been removed nor edited even though I concider these feelings of panic private.
> Another day, another day of an attacker roaming free on my account having access to my bot tokens bringing other users risk, spamming and/or hurting my friend's digital lives, and God knows what.
> 
> Another day of having severe draining effects on my mental health. Still here waiting for a solution. Still here waiting for my account to be locked. Still here waiting for instructions on how to proceed.
> 
> I appreciate all the Safety team is probably off for the weekend, however, processes like these should be automated and accounts should be locked until reports like these can be resolved.
> 
> Like I said, I'm still willing and eager to work with you to resolve the issue of my account very clearly being seized by an attacker who continues to be logged into it from what is very likely to be a foreign IP address. Please get back to me as soon as you can.

> If there was any question the account was hacked, everything's now hit the fan.

> 
> Thanks.

### Senexis, Wed, Dec 8, 2021 at 12:30 PM
> The account has been changed again. The new username is "[removed]". Email address seems to be [removed] still.

### Senexis, Thu, Dec 9, 2021 at 10:44 PM
> The account has been updated once more to "[removed]". I'll keep you updated.

### Jan (Discord), Sat, Dec 11, 2021 at 2:22 AM
> Hi [removed],
> 
> Super sorry about the delay. We are currently having an increased volume of help tickets due to current events. Thank you for your patience and understanding while we try to get back to all requests we receive.
> 
> Sadly, we are not able to remove the 2FA from accounts due to security reasons. Since you do not have access to the working 2FA codes, I'm afraid your best bet would be creating a new account, or deleting your current one if you wish to reuse the email.
> 
> If you want to continue with the deletion, you would need to confirm and explicitly tell me the registered email address that you want removed. For example, you could respond by writing, "I confirm that I would like to delete the account associated with random@email.com." depending on your email address. 
> 
> I'm so sorry again for all the inconvenience and hassle because I know how frustrating it is to create a new email and account, but please let me know if you have any other questions!
> 
> Best,
> Jan

### Senexis, Sat, Dec 11, 2021 at 10:39 AM
> No way. I wait a week and then there's no way to recover this?
> 
> What about my verified applications? What about about my early verified developer badge? What about my servers and things like that? Am I just supposed to let users of my bot know that "sorry folks, guess you don't have a bot anymore"? What about the nitro I currently am paying for?
> 
> What is the point of 2FA if it can be changed by an attacker?! This is unacceptable. I don't know how it is possible to change 2FA without access to the current 2FA method in the first place. That is insanity.
> 
> Please get back to me with an actual solution, primarily for the 4000 guilds that use my bot and the over 50000 users that serves.
> 
> I don't really mind having to delete the account, but the badge I worked hard for and the applications registered to the account are key here.
> 
> Thank you for the response anyway, I appreciate it's not your fault and I am not angry at you, just with the current situation.
> 
> [removed].

### Senexis, Sat, Dec 11, 2021 at 11:07 AM
> I have supported you so long I had an early supporter badge. Been here since around the beginning of Discord. I love your service and used it daily, if not multiple times a day.
> 
> I am so sad this is all you're able to give me so far Jan. I mentioned the servers and applications and you just didn't even mention anything about them.
> 
> Now I'll probably have to wait a week again for another response since it's Sunday now, I can't give my users any updates, and I'll be sitting here looking at an attacker using my account.

### Senexis, Sun, Dec 12, 2021 at 3:29 PM
> Hey there,
> 
> I am writing to you to hereby officially request all applications and servers to be restored to the state they were on December 3rd 2021 and then transferred from the account associated with email address [removed], namely and formerly "[removed]" [removed] to the account associated with email address [removed], namely "[removed]" [removed].
> 
> If required, I do have access to send emails and/or messages using the Senexis Discord account or email address. If required, I am able to re-verify my identity using the same identity card as the "[removed]" account linked to [removed] for purposes of the Discord verified application program.
> 
> This should be explicit enough so that you don't have to ask 1) where to transfer the requested items, 2) for confirmation regarding a transfer request, and 3) my explicit willingness to transfer the requested items to the accounts to the [removed] account.
> 
> Priority items:
> - The application associated with the bot account "[removed]" [removed]
> - The server named "[removed]" which has been deleted since the account [removed] got taken over.

### Jomar (Discord), Tue, Dec 14, 2021 at 4:12 AM
> Hey [removed],
> 
> Thanks for your responses. I'm sorry for not getting back sooner! Jomar here, just checking this ticket for my buddy Jan since he's out of the office.
> 
> We don't have any other alternative recovery methods at this point in time. Since Discord does not collect any personal information to tie to the account, our current policy is that your 2FA backup codes (that you download when you enable the 2FA and connect with your mobile device) act as your only form of official verification and proof that you are the owner of the account to disable the 2FA. So at this point in time, users must manually choose to use these backup codes to disable the 2FA on their own account and verify/confirm the disabling of the 2FA. 
> 
> On the other hand, I'd be more than happy to share your feedback about the system with the team as well. 
> 
> Best,
> Jomar

### Senexis, Tue, Dec 14, 2021 at 8:44 AM
> Hey Jomar!
> 
> I get that. I do. That's why I'm thinking differently here. Instead of being stuck on getting 2FA removed or changed, I want to now transfer access to the one thing that's most important to me so that I can continue providing a bot to my users!
> 
> I am and was no longer asking about the 2FA. I am just asking to transfer the applications to another account so that the users of my bot can get their bot again.
> 
> After that gets transfered, the account can simply be deleted.
> 
> Don't you guys actually read these?
> 
> [removed].

### Senexis, Tue, Dec 14, 2021 at 8:56 AM
> Also, Jomar,
> 
> It's been 10 days. 10 days of not being able to tell my bot users that everything is going to be okay, or not. I'm stuck in limbo here.
> 
> I had backup codes. They got changed and invalidated by the attacker. I still have access to the old ones, but alas due to "magic", they no longer work to recover the account. That's not on me, that's on you. Here, have 5/10 of them because, ya know, they don't work anyway:
> 
> - [removed]
> 
> Now please, don't get back to me with more excuses and just get me access to the application that I care about.
> 
> [removed].

### Senexis, Tue, Dec 14, 2021 at 9:06 AM
> Oh, and finally,
> 
> Since I seem to have to be very specific about what I want, by "applications" I mean https://discord.com/developers/applications, not Discord itself.

> [removed].

### Kristian (Discord), Wed, Dec 15, 2021 at 9:14 PM
> Hey [removed],
> 
> Kristian here, following up for my pal Jomar!
> 
> Just to clarify, if you are no longer logged into the account, you'll have to enter in your password and your email, and when it prompts you to enter in the 6-digit code, you should be able to ignore that prompt and use one of the 8-digit codes instead! If the codes are not working for you, could you send me a screenshot of what the error message looks like when you enter in one of the codes?
> 
> Just to isolate the issue of your codes not working:
> 1. Have you previously ever used these codes? Since they are only one-time use only? 
> 2. Have you ever reset your authenticator app, or have you ever re-synced the authenticator app with Discord WITHOUT re-downloading the backup codes (as every time you reset your authenticator app the backup codes refresh)?
> 3. Is your PC time set to automatically sync (otherwise the codes will show up as invalid)?
> 4. Try logging into the web app and try multiple browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera if you’re using the desktop app
> 
> Give these a shot and keep me updated here!
> 
> Best,
> Kristian

### Senexis, Wed, Dec 15, 2021 at 9:23 PM
> Hey there Kristian!
> 
> In lieu of having an actual solution, I'll answer all of your questions here in the hopes that I can finally get my applications transferred by you folks. Here goes:
> 
> 1. I have never used these codes before.
> 2. My authenticator app has never been reset, and was working prior to the day the account was taken over around December 4th.
> 3. The PC's time is correctly synced, and I have checked that it has been synced against multiple devices.
> 4. No matter where I log in, including other PCs, devices, and browsers, I always get the same message.
> 
> [image showing a code being used]
> 
> Please note that this is a 6th code, although I have tried all of them at this point, none of them turning out to be functional.
> 
> It seems to me that the attacker has managed to first regenerate all backup codes, invalidating the current ones, then using those in combination with their newly set password to set up their own multi factor authentication.
> 
> Hope this helps and am still waiting for something to share with my bot's users.
> 
> [removed].

### Kristian (Discord), Thu, Dec 16, 2021 at 11:05 PM
> Hey [removed],
> 
> I'm so sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately, we aren't able to remove two-factor authentication from accounts due to security reasons, and the only way you'll be able to regain access is if you saved the backup codes from inside Discord when you initially set up the two-factor authentication. If you don't have access to these codes, then you'll have to create a new account.
> 
> On the other hand, if you're unable to disable the 2FA and you would like to permanently delete the account, could you confirm and explicitly tell me the registered email address that you want to be removed and I'll be more than happy to get the process started for you. For example, you could respond by writing, "I confirm that I would like to delete the account associated with random@email.com." depending on your email address.
> 
> Note: We need to receive the account deletion request from the email address associated with the Discord account to protect our users' privacy and security. After we receive this confirmation, we can start the process manually which may take up to 15 days to complete. When the deletion has been processed, your account's data will be completely anonymized and/or deleted. Additionally, this process is non-reversible once the deletion has been completed!
> 
> I'm so sorry again for all the inconvenience and hassle because I know how frustrating it is to create a new email and account, but please let me know if you have any other questions!

> Best,

### Senexis, Thu, Dec 16, 2021 at 11:14 PM
> Congratulations, Kristian!
> 
> We've come full circle. We've reached the point me and Jan reached nearly a week ago.
> 
> So, now that we're in new territory, uncharted waters so to say, can you answer the question I had as a follow-up?
> 
> My question is, again, if you're unable to fix this stuff, is there any way to just transfer a Discord application to another account? The application in question is attached to a bot with 4000 guilds, serving over 50000 users.
> 
> Again, I am able to provide literal legal documents confirming my identity, which you have on record as well as they were required to get the application verified in the first place.
> 
> Don't come at me with ways to recover my account. I am planning to just have you guys delete it later. I'm way past trying at this point as your plans against attackers are horrible. I just want to be able to host my bot which users depend upon.
> 
> Please don't let this go back into this circle again.

Note regarding this message: This is it, I was too fed up with this chain to bother closing the mail properly.
> 3 weeks now. Nothing.

## Closing Thoughts
Do better Discord. At the time of writing this ticket has been ignored for 3 weeks. Whether I was being a jerk or not, not replying to a ticket for at least 3 weeks is bad whatever way you look at it. This article will be updated should any further replies from Discord come in.

I'm not going to sit here and tell you all communication here was professional, selfless and nice. There were moments during the panicking that I replied in a selfish, jerk way. For the record: I think Discord and their support staff are a great team, I just think their support failed here. There's no hard feelings towards any single support team member in particular, just with the way this whole chain went and how it still isn't resolved.

I am not the only one here. There's a lot of people out there who are also frustrated with having their account taken over and Discord support not being able to help them. I'm sure there have been more influential people with this issue, and I'm sure countless people without any public attention have been affected by these or similar hacks, scams, etc. Instead of focusing on adding new features, it may be time to take a while and combat these harmful issues occuring.

I would like to thank each and every one of you for sticking with me through this whole ordeal. Whether you gave a little ❤️ on a Tweet or you helped get the word out, I'm very grateful for all the support you have given me. In addition I'd like to thank the Patreon supporters for their continued support even though they have no reason to. Thanks for sticking with me through all this! Finally, a special shoutout to Magnar from the [RDC community](https://twitter.com/RedDeadRDC), whom helped me reach out to Discord support through the Partner Server. Even though it was fruitless, I'm very grateful for it and all the supportive private messages Maggie has sent. Thanks again all of you!

RDO Compendium isn't done. I'll keep updating you folks [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RDOCompendium). Thanks once more for your continued patience! Outlaws for life.
